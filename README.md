### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
Creating an awesome starter template for React Native projects. I come from the fantastical world of the Djangonauts in which there is a project starter far superior to all others named "Cookiecutter Django." As I started to get into the idea of mono-repos for cross platform apps I wanted to make something similar for my React Native Web projects. One of the best parts of Cookiecutter Django was that it came pre configured for deployment and user auth. So I'm adding those to the ignitie template with design features from NativeBase. Thinking for the backend I'll include a list of options for the database to choose from.
