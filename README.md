### Hi there 👋


- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...


Creating an awesome starter template for React Native projects. 
I come from the fantastical world of the Djangonauts in which there is a project starter far superior to all others named "Cookiecutter Django." 
As I started to get into the idea of mono-repos for cross platform apps I wanted to make a cross-platform equivalent. One of the best parts of Cookiecutter Django was that it came pre configured for deployment and user-auth. 
So, I'm adding those to the Ignitie template with design features from NativeBase aswell as GraphQL integration. 
Right now, I'm thinking of ExpressJS and Neo4J for the framework and database respectively. 
Have yet to settle on built in proxy server provider for deployment.
