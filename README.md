### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Julian. Founder of [Botnie](https://botnie.com) and [Premium Puts](https://premiumputs.com). I love working on startups, greenfield projects, and open source projects. I'm really familiar with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) dev and recently I've been transitioning my main stack to [GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/), [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v2/), and [Neo4j Database](https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql-manual/current/). It's great being able to maintain graph data stuctures throughout the entire stack with cross platform capabilities and easy integration with [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) when machine learning and large scale data processing is desired. However, I still like to build out my crawlers in plain old Python. Old habits die hard. You can find my personal site and learn more [here](https://julianwagle.com).
