### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Julian. Founder of [Botnie](https://botnie.com) and [Premium Puts](https://premiumputs.com). I love working on startups and on open source projects. I'm really familiar with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) dev and recently I've been transitioning my main stack to [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). You can find my personal site and learn more [here](https://julianwagle.com).


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...


Creating an awesome starter template for React Native projects. 
I come from the fantastical world of the Djangonauts in which there is a project starter far superior to all others named "Cookiecutter Django." 
As I started to get into the idea of mono-repos for cross platform apps I wanted to make a cross-platform equivalent. One of the best parts of Cookiecutter Django was that it came pre configured for deployment and user-auth. 
So, I'm adding those to the Ignitie template with design features from NativeBase.
